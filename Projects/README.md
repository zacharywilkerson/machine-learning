This repo documents all ML projects I've worked on/am working on. 

[x] **Convolutional Neural Networks for MNIST Classification**: 
> In this paper, we use a convolutional neural network to classify the MNIST dataset. 

[x] **Autoencoders for Kuzushiji-MNIST Digit Classification**: 
> In this paper, we evaluate the performance of two neural network models, a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network, on the task of image classification using the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset. We find that the convolutional neural network achieves higher performance when compared to the multilayer perceptron.

[x] **An Evaluation of Current Network Based Models on Kuzushiji-MNIST Dataset**:
> In this project, we compare the accuracy of an autoencoder with and without an ITL regularizer alongside an MLP to a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the task of character classification on the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.
