This repo documents all ML projects I've worked on/am working on. 

:heavy_check_mark: [**Convolutional Neural Networks for MNIST Classification**](https://github.com/zacharywilkerson/machine-learning/blob/main/Projects/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.pdf): 
> In this paper, we use a convolutional neural network to classify the MNIST dataset. 

:heavy_check_mark: [**Autoencoders for Kuzushiji-MNIST Digit Classification**](https://github.com/zacharywilkerson/machine-learning/blob/main/Projects/Autoencoders%20for%20Kuzushiji-MNIST%20Digit%20Classification.pdf): 
> In this paper, we evaluate the performance of two neural network models, a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network, on the task of image classification using the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset. We find that the convolutional neural network achieves higher performance when compared to the multilayer perceptron.

:heavy_check_mark: [**An Evaluation of Current Network Based Models on Kuzushiji-MNIST Dataset**](https://github.com/zacharywilkerson/machine-learning/blob/main/Projects/An%20Evaluation%20of%20Current%20Network%20Based%20Models%20on%20Kuzushiji-MNIST%20Dataset.pdf):
> In this project, we compare the accuracy of an autoencoder with and without an ITL regularizer alongside an MLP to a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the task of character classification on the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.
